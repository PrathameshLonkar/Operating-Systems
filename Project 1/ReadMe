For this assignment I have reffered from various online sources to understand and implement the functionality of functions such as execcvp and dup2 etc.
So far i have not added the code for pipes as i was having some errors and difficulties in implementing them, regardless i will still be workin on the code to execute the pipes properly.

This code will run the following commands:
1.)ls
2.)ls -la
3.)ls -la > output.txt
4.)ls -la < output.txt
5.)sort < output.txt

and various other functions related to sorting.

I have implemented my code over the code provided by Prof. Kartik Gopalan and also reffered to some code refered by Prof. Tom.
